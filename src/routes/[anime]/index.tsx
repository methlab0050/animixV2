        Hey
        <br /><br />
        This is where anime info would go
        <br /><br />
        Like the title, a synopsis, cover art, a selection of episodes, etc
        <br /><br />
        Try to add as much as possible, while still looking sleek
        <br /><br />
        You can check out <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4654462/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3">imdb</a> for an example of what this might look like
    </>
